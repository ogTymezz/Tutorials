## 🧭 What Are the Farlands?

The **Farlands** in Roblox are glitched areas far beyond the intended map limits, where floating-point precision starts breaking down. At **144,000,000,000 studs from spawn**, physics and rendering go completely haywire — this is known as the **EXTREME Farlands**.

## 🔧 Requirements

- A Roblox **Baseplate** game or custom flat map  
- A custom-built **teleport script** or **speed hack module**  
- A **PC with high memory** (preferably 16GB+ RAM)
- Lots of patience 😅

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Create or Load a Baseplate Game**
Start with a baseplate to avoid unnecessary lag. You can use Roblox Studio to open a new Baseplate template.

### 2. **Insert a Teleport Script**

Use this Lua script to teleport your character far away:

```lua
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local char = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
local hrp = char:WaitForChild("HumanoidRootPart")

-- TELEPORT TO EXTREME FARLANDS
local destination = Vector3.new(1.44e11, 10, 0) -- 144 billion studs on the X axis
hrp.CFrame = CFrame.new(destination)
